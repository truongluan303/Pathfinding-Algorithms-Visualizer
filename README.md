# Pathfinding-and-Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer (pathfinding in progress)
A Visualizer for:
  - Pathfinding algorithms including A*, Dijkstra, Breadth First Search, and Depth First Search
  - Sorting algorithms including selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort

libraries used for GUI: pygame and tkinter


!!! pygame must be installed for the program to run !!!

the script install_pygame.py will automatically install pygame after being run

So if pygame is not yet installed on your computer, just run the script once and it should be good
